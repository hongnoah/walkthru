  <h1>Legends Only</h1>
  <p>My name is Noah Hong, I am 17 years old and was born in Bellevue, Washington. I was born on June 3rd, 2006. I grew up in Sammamish and never left. I went to Sammamish Lutheran Hills Church for my preschool. It is right across from the KCLS library and Skyline. I went to Elementary school called Creekside, and for middle school I went to Pine Lake. Now for high school I am going to Skyline. I am extremely thankful for where and who I live with. I live really close to Skyline in an average size home. I used to live with my mom, dad, 2 older sisters and a dog. But now I live like an only child with my mom, dad and 2 dogs now. My oldest sister just graduated college at Cal Poly SLO and is doing her master's degree there this school year. I don’t get to see her a lot but when I do I am happy. My other sister goes to UC Irvine and is also not home. I also am happy when she comes back home. I think many people think I am just the typical nerdy Asian boy who wants to become a doctor. But that’s not me. If anything, I am almost the opposite of that. Although I am smart I’m not the smartest in the world. I also do not want to become a doctor. As a kid I had a couple of hobbies, but they changed over the years. When I was younger my hobby was playing and learning about trucks. I had the dream to be a garbage truck driver. Then time went on and my hobby was Legos. Then I got old enough for sports and I signed up for soccer. Since then, only 1 thing has changed. My hobbies. Now my hobbies are sports, mostly soccer and video games. Since a young age I have played soccer for a club called Eastside FC. I started soccer to get some exercise in a fun way, but after my first year I knew this was something I wanted to continue doing. And my passion has not stopped yet. Because of soccer I have traveled a lot. Although I almost never traveled when I was a kid, soccer started when we went on some out of state and country vacations. My first place I traveled to was Mexico. Mexico was the place I have been to the most on vacations. Other people have gone to Hawaii, Disneyland, Florida and other places. But me I have been to Mexico around 6 times and I have never been to Hawaii, Disneyland, Florida or any other places special. I then proceeded to go to many places including California, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Canada, etc due to soccer. I have great friends that will always be there for me and support me. They have impacted me in every way and made me a better person. Without my friends I don’t know what I would have ended up like. I am Christian and I went to this church school on Wednesday called Awana after school. I got too old for it a couple of years ago. It was located in Bothell. I went to this school for 10 years. I am mentioning this because I am very proud of something I did at this church school. Out of the 10 years I was at this school, I never missed it one time, because of this, I got an award called perfect attendance for all 10 years and I am very proud of that. I am also proud of all the trophies and medals I have from soccer. During the summer times every year for soccer, we have tournaments. Most of the tournaments are to get to know the players and see how the team will play together. But many of those years my team has won the tournaments and got medals or trophies. I am very proud of that. I am also proud of my culture. I am Korean and I love embracing their culture. One thing I love most about Korea is their food. My favorite foods are Korean. For example there is a food called Soon Tubu. It is a spicy tofu soup with your own choice of meat like pork, beef, and seafood and it is really yummy. Another one of my favorite things from Korea is Korean BBQ. Korean BBQ is basically all types of different meats and veggies that you grill on a mini grill type thing. Most restaurants that do this do it ALL YOU CAN EAT meaning you can just keep on ordering meats and veggies till you can’t eat anymore.</p>
