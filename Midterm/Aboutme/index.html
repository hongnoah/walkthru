<h3>Hobbies/Activities!</h3>
<p>One of my favorite activities to do when I have freetime is to play video games.<br>
   This has become a big part of things I like to do becaue of the pandemic.<br>
  One game that I have been trying to get really good at is Fortnite.<br>
I just got a PC so I am not that good.<br>
Another activity is playing and watching sports.<br>

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <h2>Sports</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to watch and play sports, whether it is competively or with family.
  I play soccer for Eastside FC. I am hoping to continue playing in college. I love watching soccer as well. My favorite teams are of course the Seattle Sounders in the MLS and Tottenham Hotspur from Premier League. I also love watching football. My favortie team is the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
  <p>Another one of my favorite hobbies especially has been gaming. I grew up gaming on an iPad, then I moved to an iPhone, then to a Xbox, and now finally to a PC. Throughout all those years I have narrowed my games to only a few. On iPad and iPhone the main games I would play would either be Clash Royale or HayDay. I eventually played some games on the Xbox. I mainly played Madden and Fifa. Then just during Christmas time this year I got a PC and started to play Fortnite hoping to get better.</p>

  <h1>Goals</h1>
  <p> I would like to finish this class with a good grade so it doesn't drop my GPA. In college I would like to major in some sort of engineering, I'm not sure of what engineer yet but hopefully I will soon.</p>
